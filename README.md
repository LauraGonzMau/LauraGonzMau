- 👋 Hi, I’m @LauraGonzMau
- 👀 I’m interested in web sites, how to create them and how to continue to develop them through the time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, TS, to continue in some days with a long list of new material to learn.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web site creation and translation of site to Spanish if needed.
- 📫 How to reach me: it’s possible to mail me to laura.gonzmau.75@gmail.com , (I only used this mail for learning and working, not spam or publicity here, please.)
